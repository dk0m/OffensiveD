Utilizing DLang For Offensive Operations.

## Why D?

Due to **DLang** being rarely used in malware, This makes it very good for malware developers to utilize it in their offensive operations, Combining that with the fact that D can call C code and its decent FFI, We get a powerful language for malware.
